In reinforcement learning, the appropriate action is such that it maximises the reward, or it could be said that the action is exploitative.

The most common technique for exploration in reinforcement learning is random exploration [1]. In this type of approach, the agent decides what to do randomly regardless of its progress.

This review focuses on exploratory approaches which fulfil at least one of the following criteria: (i) determines the exploration degree based on the agentâ€™s learning, (ii) actively decides to take certain actions in hopes of finding new outcomes, and (iii) motivates itself to
continue exploring despite a lack of environmental rewards.
